# ðŸŽ“ GradeAI: Predicting Student Performance Using Machine Learning

**GradeAI** is a machine learning project built to predict studentsâ€™ final grades using real-world academic and behavioral data. It demonstrates how AI can be used in educational settings to forecast outcomes and support decision-making.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To build a predictive model that estimates a studentâ€™s final grade (G3) based on various input features like past grades, study time, absences, and family support.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** â€“ Data preprocessing and analysis
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Machine learning (Linear Regression)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset is from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository / OpenML**, featuring:
- G1, G2 (past grades)
- Study time
- Failures
- Absences
- Family support
- And more

## ðŸ”„ Workflow
1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
3. Train a **Linear Regression** model
4. Evaluate using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
5. Visualize predictions and model performance

## ðŸŽ¯ Output
Given a student's input data, the model predicts their final exam grade (G3).

## ðŸ¤– Why Itâ€™s AI-Based
The system uses a supervised machine learning model to learn from historical data and make predictions â€” a foundational application of AI in real-world scenarios.
